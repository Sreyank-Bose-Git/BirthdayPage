#About this Project#

This Project is a way to wish your loved one's happy birthday!
This is not that advanced as you would expect.

I was initally creating this project for my grandmother,
but then I decided to make it useful for the birthday for anyone.

This is one of my first projects using:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. PHP
And is the first website that has multiple pages that are for different purposes.

#How to use#

@Option 1

To use this project, you may install the php compiler and create a local server by using the command:

                php -S localhost:<the prefered port>

Make sure you run this command in the project directory.

@Option 2

If you know of any php compiler in the web, you may use them too.
Place the folder in their respective places in that website,
and it should work.
